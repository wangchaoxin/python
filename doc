2 How to use pip with Python 3.x alongside Python 2.x
    The approach you should take is to install pip for Python 3.2.
    You do this in the following way:
    $ curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
    $ sudo python3.2 get-pip.py
    Then, you can install things for Python 3.2 with pip-3.2, and install things for Python 2-7 with pip-2.7
